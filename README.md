The idea of this application is to create user-friendly Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition) Character Sheets which will be accessible on any computer. It will first take in a Username and Password which you will register, then you will be able to create and save Character Sheets onto your personal account you have created.

Once the User logs in, they will be taken to a Home section with a dropdown menu. In this dropdown menu, they will be able to select past characters they have created, or they will be able to create a new character.

Selecting any of the options in the dropdown menu will lead them into the Character Sheet page. This will be a page where they can edit anything on a Character Sheet. There will be a save button at the bottom, and a delete button in the bottom corner, slightly out of the way so there are minimal accidental deletes. The delete button will have a confirmation prompt the User will have to select to actually delete a Character sheet.
